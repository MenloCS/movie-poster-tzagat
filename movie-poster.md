# Movie Poster Project

You will design a movie poster step by step, using AI as a creative tool—not a shortcut.  
At each step, save and commit your work in GitHub Desktop.

## Using GitHub Desktop (Mac)

1. **Edit** this file (`movie-poster-project.md`) in TextEdit.  
2. **Save** your changes.  
3. Open **GitHub Desktop**.  
   - Check that `movie-poster-project.md` shows up under **Changes**.  
   - Write a commit summary (see below).  
   - Click **Commit to main**.  
4. Click **Push origin** (top bar) to upload to GitHub.com.  

**Commit Messages for Each Step**
- Step 1: *Completed creative brief*  
- Step 2: *Documented first two AI attempts*  
- Step 3: *Documented final AI attempts*

# Movie Poster Steps

## Step 1: Creative Brief
*(Commit message: "Completed creative brief")*

Before you open any AI tools, plan your vision. This is your anchor—return to it after every AI generation.

**Your Movie Choice:**  
- **Movie Title: Anaconda  
- **Why I chose this movie: I saw it recently and liked the idea of the movie, but thought it could be better  

**Core Emotion:**  
What ONE feeling should a viewer get from your poster? (Examples: wonder, fear, joy, excitement, mystery, tension, nostalgia)  
- **Core emotion: Fear, tension  

**Essential Visual Element:**  
What ONE image, object, or visual MUST appear on your poster?  
- **Essential element: Some part of a very large anaconda  
- **Why this element: It's the main part of the movie  

**What NOT to Include:**  
What do you definitely NOT want? (This helps you evaluate AI outputs critically.)  
- **Avoid: Making the people on the poster look to scared, because they shouldn't realize the snake is there   

**Color Palette:**  
- **Dominant color(s): Green, brown  
- **Accent color(s): Black around edges  
- **Overall mood: Can be dark like at night or during the day, should be pretty cool colors  

**Composition:**  
- [ ] Close-up (face/detail)  
- [ ] Wide shot (landscape/setting)  
- [ ] Medium shot (full figure)  
- [ ] Object/symbol centered  
- [ ] Character collage  

- **Focal point description: Pretty wide shot with landscape

## Step 2: AI Generation – First Attempts
*(Commit message: "Documented first two AI attempts")*

Open Adobe Firefly. Generate images based on your creative brief, but remember: you're exploring possibilities, not looking for a final answer.

**Attempt 1:**  
- **My prompt:Can you make a movie poster that is a wide landscape shot of a boat on a river in the amazon with a large anaconda somewhere slowly moving towards the boat and people  

- **What worked: Most of it looked good  
- **What didn't work: poster not really scary 
- **What I'll change for next attempt: Highlight the scary aspect  

**Attempt 2:**  
- **My prompt: Can you make a movie poster that is a wide landscape shot of people on a boat in the amazon going away into the distance near sunset, and there is a very large anaconda snake following them?  

- **What worked: Not mentioning anything about horror, clearly describing what I wanted  
- **What didn't work: the people going away from the snake  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: keep describing where I want the people and snake

## Step 3: AI Generation – Continued Iteration
*(Commit message: "Documented final AI attempts")*

Keep refining. Try at least two more meaningfully different directions.

**Attempt 3:**  
- **My prompt: Can you make a movie poster that is a wide landscape shot of people on a boat in the amazon moving away from the front of the poster into the distance of a sunset, and there is a very large anaconda snake following them? 

- **What worked: Not much  
- **What didn't work: Describing where I wanted everything  
- **What I'll change for next attempt: I don't know  

**Attempt 4:**  
- **My prompt: Can you make a movie poster that is a wide landscape shot of people on a boat in the amazon moving away from the front of the poster into the distance of a sunset, and there is a very large anaconda snake following them behind them where the people on the boat cant see it, and have the anaconda be pretty low above the water

  

- **What worked: All the elements of the background  
- **What didn't work: Telling it where to put the different things in the image 

**Final AI Image Selected:** (Which attempt? Why?)
The second attempt, it was closest to my vision

## Step 4: Photoshop Modifications
*(Commit message: "Added Photoshop modifications")*

Export your best AI generation and open it in Photoshop. You must make at least TWO intentional modifications. The AI gave you raw material—now make it yours.

**Modification Ideas:**
- Crop or reframe the image  
- Adjust colors, contrast, or brightness  
- Add the movie title (typography matters!)  
- Add a tagline  
- Combine elements from multiple AI generations  
- Remove unwanted elements  

**Your Modifications:**  
1.  
2.  
3. (optional)  

**Save your final poster as:** `final-poster.jpg` or `final-poster.png`  
**Drag your final poster file into your GitHub repo folder before committing.**

## Step 5: Reflection
*(Commit message: "Completed reflection")*

**How did your vision evolve?**  
Compare your original creative brief to your final poster. What changed? What stayed the same?  


**What decision are you most proud of that the AI didn't make for you?**  


**What would you do differently next time?**

*Remember: The goal isn't to get AI to make something for you. The goal is to use AI as one tool in YOUR creative process.*
